Astrodynamics

An expansion of what was originally a final project for a physics class designed to model the effects of a gravity assist. The expanded version now considers more comprehensive aspects of orbital trajectories including apses, conversion of Cartesian to Keplerian orbital parameters, and visualizations of simulated trajectores.
