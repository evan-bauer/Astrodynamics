When I first started this project for my university physics course, I had no (immediate) intention to take it much further, certainly not to the degree where I would make it public and put it on GitHub. Admittedly, the only reason any of this is here on GitHub is because it wasn't originally good enough for *me*. I wanted to create something I could use to model the phenomenon while *proving to myself* I understood the mechanics.

And then, I just didn't want to stop. There will always be improvements to make and new Python techniques and strategies to learn and master. As with anyone, I do have my limits, which brings me to the penultimate section of this file:

Any and all contributions to this project are not only **welcomed** but ***invited***! I am always looking for ways to improve upon and perfect this project. Please feel free to contact me via LinkedIn or my email with any ideas, suggestions, bug fixes, anything! 

*Most importantly,* ***thank you!***
